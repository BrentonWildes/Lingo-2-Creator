# Lingo 2

Thanks for your interest in making custom content for Lingo 2! You'll find here a slightly modified version of the Lingo 2 code base, with most scenes and songs removed and a few of the files changed. Once you've finished and are ready to publish, you should _also_ check it in the main Lingo 2 game, to make sure it works how you expect it to. Please join our Discord for more information.

## Engine

Use [Godot 4.3 with SteamWorks](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/releases/tag/v4.12) to test your builds.

## Testing

Load your maps into your Game Data > maps folder, then select them in Level Select. You may find other/better/easier ways to test, but this method is how players will access your content (at least for now, until we have Workshop).
